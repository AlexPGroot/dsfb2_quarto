Welcome to my personal website.
I am a student life sciences majoring in molecular biology at the Hogeschool Utrecht and I have interests in biology, bioinformatics and also general data science. 

I enjoy working with- and analyzing data and I like building stuff, check out my mostly R related [Projects](/projects.qmd) page for some things I've worked on.
